== Features
* Let Rails apps mention Ubuntu packages to install

== Security
* Agent forwarding for Git checkout (see Capistrano) - avoids passphraseless key requirement
* Set app user system password at all? If so, do from ~/.deploy_credentials. Randomize?
* Non-root MySQL for app user, root MySQL only for migrations
** Needs to set up user security when creating tables. Reasonable?

== Databases
* Randomize server root password, put into ~/.deploy_credentials
* How to back up and restore MySQL remotely
* Automatic regular backup - where to?

== Fun Ideas
* Clone dotfiles into home dir of app users - easy poking around

== Windows
