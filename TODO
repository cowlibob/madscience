== Correctness
* After new Capistrano deploy, make sure static content is properly updated. If not, restart NGinX on deploy

* Agent forwarding for Git checkout (see Capistrano) - avoids passphraseless key requirement

** Needs to set up user security when creating tables. Reasonable?

== Databases
* Randomize server root password somehow
* How to back up and restore MySQL remotely
* Automatic regular backup - where to?
