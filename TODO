== Features
* Set up Capistrano for app, including Vagrant deploy environment
* Make credentials directory, generate SSH keys, ask for user password(s)
* Let Rails apps mention Ubuntu packages to install

== Security
* SSH key for app user - authorized_keys for deploy user(s)
* Additional authorized SSH keys locally, public portion only
* ~/.ssh/authorized_keys - mode 0600
* add repository to list of known hosts?
* Agent forwarding for Git checkout (see Capistrano) - needed to avoid passphraseless keys
* Figure out password stuff for app user


== Fun Ideas
* Clone dotfiles into home dir of app users - easy poking around
